# Sentiment-Analysis-with-RNN-LSTM-Custom-NER-Model-for-Restaurant-Reviews


This repository contains a comprehensive analysis of sentiment in customer reviews from the Restaurant_Reviews.tsv dataset, employing Recurrent Neural Networks (RNN), Long Short-Term Memory (LSTM) models for sentiment analysis, and a Custom Named Entity Recognition (NER) model. The primary objectives encompass evaluating sentiment analysis models, creating a custom NER model to extract specific entities from reviews, and deriving insights based on NER results.
Contents:

Dataset: Includes the Restaurant_Reviews.tsv dataset for analysis.

Sentiment Analysis:
Developed Sentiment Analysis models using RNN and LSTM architectures.
Evaluated the performance of each model and determined the best-performing one based on various metrics.
Predicted sentiment scores for the reviews using the selected model.

Custom NER Model:
Created a custom NER model using all 500 rows of customer review data.
Manually defined labels for NER entities using the NER Annotator tool and exported annotated data as .json for model training.

Insights and Visualization :
Utilized the custom NER model to extract top 5 positive and negative review insights.
Presented insights effectively through visualization methods, showcasing the NER results and sentiment analysis findings.

Steps to Reproduce:

Sentiment Analysis:
Review the notebooks or scripts associated with RNN and LSTM models for sentiment analysis.
Evaluate model performances and predictions for sentiment scores.

Custom NER Model:
Refer to the annotated data exported as .json and the training script to create the custom NER model.
Utilize the model to extract entities such as restaurant names, types, price, quality, etc., from the reviews.

Insights and Visualization:
Explore the notebooks or scripts depicting how the custom NER model was used to extract insights.
Review visualizations that effectively present positive and negative review insights derived from the NER analysis.
